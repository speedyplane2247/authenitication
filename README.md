# authenitication
various authentication using my authentication library (for C++, JS, and C# apps)
## keys posted here don't work
my library encrypts and decrypts them on the client to whatever. decryptor changes 5 minutes on a different server and verifies the app before sending/recieving

pretty secure but im not really doing anything of value so whatever
## library
haven't even really named it (it's currently crypt and succ.bin) but its rn only for mac and linux but coulud port it to windows maybe later

but neat
